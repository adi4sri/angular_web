			<h2>bTIPt PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	    </div>
			<p><u>bTIPt, LLC , as regards users originating from within the United States, respects the privacy of its users and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, application, or other online services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br/>
			If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.
			</u></p>
			<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
			<h3>**INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h3>
			<p><b>Personal Information:</b> We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, and mobile number (“Personal Information”). We may collect this Personal Information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you create a user profile. The current required data fields are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Email</li>
				<li>Password</li>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Mobile Phone Number</li>
				<li>Zip Code</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>**INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES</h3>
			<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to provide to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“<b>Usage Information</b>”). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<b>Device Identifier</b>”) for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Services (any, a “<b>Device</b>”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be anonymous or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. The mobile phone (tipper’s and tippee’s) will send GPS coordinates to our servers. We collect this geolocation information for various purposes, including to determine the tip for the location and service, industry and to provide you with customer support, to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes. We may also have features that allow you to share this information with other people (such as your family, friends or colleagues).</p>
			<p>A few of the methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed):</p>
			<p><b>Cookies:</b> a cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of information to you. You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p><b>Web Beacons:</b> small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web. Web beacons or similar technologies help us better manage content on our Services by informing us what content is effective, count users of the Services, monitor how users navigate the Services, count how many e-mails that we send were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ Personal Information.</p>
			<p><b>Embedded Scripts:</b> an embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>How we use the information we collect</p>
			<p><u>In General.</u> We may use information that we collect about you to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>deliver our products and services, and manage our business;</li>
				<li>manage your account and provide you with customer support;</li>
				<li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others;</li>

				<li>develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;</li>
				<li>perform ad tracking and website or mobile application analytics;</li>
				<li>verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;</li>
				<li>enforce or exercise any rights in our terms and conditions;</li>
				<li>perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection; and</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>**INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU</h3>
			<p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
			<h3>**INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY</h3>
			<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Services. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program, and do not use this information for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality through our Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>
			<h3>**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h3>
			<p>Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet computer or similar device (“Mobile Application”). You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your preferred language and country site (if applicable)</li>
				<li>Your phone number or other unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device – such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID number</li>
				<li>The IP address of your mobile device</li>
				<li>The manufacturer and model of your mobile device</li>
				<li>Your mobile operating system</li>
				<li>The type of mobile Internet browsers you are using</li>
				<li>Your geolocation</li>
				<li>Information about how you interact with the Mobile Application and any of our web sites to which the Mobile Application links, such as how many times you use a specific part of the mobile application over a given time period, the amount of time you spend using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile Application, actions you take in the Mobile Application and how you engage with the Mobile Application</li>
				<li>Information to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the Mobile Application</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We may use information automatically collected by the Mobile Application (including the Mobile Device Information) in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To operate and improve our Mobile Applications, other Services, our company’s services, and tools;</li>
				<li>To create aggregated and anonymized information to determine which Mobile Application features are most popular and useful to users, and for other statistical analyses;</li>
				<li>To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to investigate fraud, chargeback or other matters;</li>
				<li>To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for you, or the communications sent to you through the Mobile Application.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that geo-location information for various purposes – including for the tippee to be able to set up the work location, to activate the application, for the tipper to identify the tippee that is close to your location, to provide average tip for location by industry, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to provide gratuity and service feedback via bTIPt’s Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device level. Instead, use near field communication, bTIPt Code or QR code could be used for identification.</p>
			<p>We will not provide a tipper’s Personal Information (such as your last name and your photo, if you have chosen to upload your photo to your profile) to the tippee/partners who received a gratuity and comments. The employers of the tippee will be able to access the tippee’s Personal Information, including his/her geo-location data.</p>
			<p>We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage information with any Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
			<p>Personal Information may also be collected and shared with third-parties if there is content from the Mobile Application that you specifically and knowingly upload to share with or transmit to an email recipient, online community, website, or to the public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or information about you or your tippee that you choose to share with others through features which may be provided on our Services. Please note, however, that this uploaded, shared or transmitted content will also be subject to the privacy policy of the email, online community website, social media or other platform to which you upload, share or transmit the content.</p>

			<p>If you join bTIPt as a tippee through our web site(s), we will collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number and may collect additional information such as resume, ratings, gender, and your ethnicity.</p>

			<h3>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED?</h3>
			<p>Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information or Usage Information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Services.</p>
			<p>Based upon the Personal Information you provide us when registering for an account, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone, or SMS or text message, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
			<p>We use your information to closely monitor which features of the Services are used most, to allow you to view your tip history, view any promotions we may currently be running and to determine which features we need to focus on improving, including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources.</p>
			<p>We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that we are able to serve you the correct app version depending on your device type, for troubleshooting and in some cases, marketing purposes. The credit card information you provide in your personal profile at sign-up is not stored by us, but is stored and used by our third party payment processor(s) in order for them to process your payments made in connection with the Services. We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site(s). Your IP address is used to help identify you, but contains no personal information about you.</p>
			<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.<br>
			In addition, we may use your Personal Information or Usage Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties; (2) to process your registration with the Services, including verifying your information is active and valid; (3) to improve the Services or our other services, to customize your experience with the Services, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (4) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Services’ features such as online or mobile entry sweepstakes, contests or other promotions; (5) to contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to the Services and/or the Services’ policies; (6) for internal business purposes; (7) for inclusion in our data analytics; and (8) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br/>

			<h3>DOES THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES APPEAR ON THE SERVICES?</h3>
			<p>The Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from any online or mobile Services are served to your browser. In addition, when you are using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from one of our websites onto a different web site. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites or applications before submitting any Personal Information to third parties.</p>

			<h3>WHAT ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES AND WIDGETS?</h3>
			<p>Our online and mobile Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our online and mobile Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our online or mobile Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our online Services. Your interactions with these features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>

			<h3>HOW DO I CHANGE MY INFORMATION AND WHAT IF I CANCEL MY ACCOUNT?</h3>
			<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your Personal Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on your profile page or by contacting us through info@btipt.com. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

			<p>You may also cancel or modify your communications that you have elected to receive from the Services by following the instructions contained within an e-mail or by logging into your user account and changing your communication preferences.</p>

			<p>If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us through info@btipt.com.</p>

			<p>We will retain your Personal Information and Usage Information (including geo-location) for as long as your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you services. Even after your account is terminated, we will retain your Personal Information and Usage Information (including geo-location, trip history, transaction history) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to cancellation of an account (such as addressing chargebacks from your credit card companies), investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other lawful business reason. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Services effectively, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for analytic purposes.</p>

			<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

			<p>We restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a person under 18, we will delete that information immediately. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor under the age of eighteen (18) and believe he or she has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at Privacy at bTIPt.</p>

			<h3>SECURITY</h3>
			<p>The Personal Information and Usage Information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information - such as any portions of your credit card number which we retain (we do not ourselves retain your entire credit card information) and geo-location information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.</p>

			<h3>UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY?</h3>
			<p>From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

			<h3>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
			<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure (opt-in) or if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing (opt-out).</p>

			<p>We have elected to follow this alternative approach and, therefore, we do not share Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with permission at the time you provide such Personal Information.</p>

			<h4>Onward transfer and consent to international processing</h4>
			<p>We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately protected but we cannot always know where personal information may be accessed or processed. While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer personal information or other information to our offices outside of the United States.
